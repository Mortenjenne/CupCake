## Project Overview
The *Olsker Cupcakes Project* is a web-based system prototype developed as part of the second semester of the Computer Science (Datamatiker) program.  
The goal is to create a digital platform that allows customers to design and order custom cupcakes online, while enabling administrators to manage orders and users efficiently.

The system serves as an initial step in Olsker Cupcakes’ digital transformation, with potential for future extensions such as inventory management, customer analytics, and a mobile app.

## Background
Olsker Cupcakes is a small, organic bakery located in Olsker, Bornholm, owned by Jonas Møller and Emil Vang.  
The bakery specializes in handmade cupcakes made from local, sustainable ingredients.  
To enhance visibility and customer convenience, the company sought a digital solution allowing customers to browse the selection, customize cupcakes (by choosing base and topping), and place online orders for in-store pickup.

## Vision
The vision behind the project is to make Olsker Cupcakes’ products more accessible and to strengthen the brand’s digital presence.

The key user stories guiding the project include:
- Customers can create an account and order cupcakes with custom combinations of bottom and topping.  
- Customers can view, edit, and pay for their orders online.  
- Administrators can view all users and orders, manage payments, and remove invalid or unpaid orders.  
- Guests can make purchases without registration.  

All user stories have been implemented and tested as of submission.

- Integration tests completed on three out of five Mappers (all passing).  
- All pages styled and mobile-friendly (except admin overview).  
- Service layer implemented for revenue and statistics calculations (not integrated in the final views).
